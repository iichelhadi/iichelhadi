## ðŸ§ª Featured Projects

- ðŸ’¡ [**miEdgeR**](https://github.com/iichelhadi/miedgeR)  
  R package for mutual information-based gene regulatory network inference, hypergraph module detection, and pseudotime-aware analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data. Supports network integration with trajectory analysis.

- ðŸŽ¯ [**Neoantigen_detection_pipeline**](https://github.com/iichelhadi/Neoantigen_detection_pipeline)  
  End-to-end WES + RNA-seq pipeline for tumor neoantigen discovery using paired tumor-normal samples. Includes variant calling, HLA typing, epitope prediction, and prioritization for immunotherapy applications.

- ðŸ§¬ [**RNA-seq Analysis Shiny App**](https://github.com/iichelhadi/Shiny_apps/tree/main/RNA-seq_analysis_app)  
  An interactive Shiny application designed for analyzing RNA-seq data. The app offers an interactive interface that enables users to upload RNA-seq datasets, perform various analyses, and visualize the results directly within their browser. Designed for researchers with minimal coding experience.
